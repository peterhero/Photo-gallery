					<p id="photo-description">Iceland is no doubt one of the hottest new travel destinations, increasing exponentially in interest over the past few years. The #1 destination in Iceland is The Blue Lagoon. Last year, it had a record number of international visitors totally 700,000. The Blue Lagoon is a natural, geothermal spa sunk into a lava field and is known for its mineral-rich healing waters. Families book with care, as children under 2 are not allowed in the pools. Children between the ages of 2 and 8 are required to wear arm floaties.</p>
